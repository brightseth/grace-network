    title: "Early Artistic Foundations",
    description: `Seth's journey began on stage rather than behind a computer. As a child in the late 1970s and early 1980s, he immersed himself in theater, performing in avant-garde productions at the American Repertory Theater in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

"When I was a kid in the late 70's, my dad worked as a quality assurance consultant for computer companies up and down Boston's Route 128. He tested new machines and software packages, looking for bugs. One night he brought me to his office at Applicon, an early CAD pioneer, and showed me a digital image of a bear. It was the first computer graphic I had ever seen."

This early exposure to both performing arts and nascent computer technology created the foundation for Seth's unique perspective. In 1984, at age 14, he was cast by Robert Wilson for the restaging of the Cologne section of "Civil WarS," marking the beginning of a long relationship with experimental theater and multimedia art.

Seth attended Interlochen Arts Academy in Michigan for his senior year of high school, surrounding himself with musicians, poets, dancers, and fellow actors. This immersive creative environment further shaped his interdisciplinary approach. He then studied Dramatic Literature at Columbia University, where he continued his theatrical pursuits while developing a deeper theoretical understanding of narrative and performance.`

    title: "The Digital Art Pioneer",
    description: `After graduating from Columbia in 1992, Seth began working as an archivist for Robert Wilson's foundation in SoHo, the Byrd Hoffman Foundation. This position gave him intimate access to Wilson's groundbreaking body of work, from the 7-day play "Ka Mountain" in Iran to the revolutionary opera "Einstein on the Beach" with Philip Glass.

"My real passion growing up, though, was theater. I started as a child actor in avant garde productions at the American Repertory Theater in Cambridge, MA. In 1984, when I was 14, I was cast by Robert Wilson for his restaging of the Cologne section of the 'Civil WarS' and he became a huge influence on me."

Seth's technological vision emerged in this artistic context. In 1992, he conceived the Interactive Multimedia Archives Project (IMAP), a pioneering effort to digitize Wilson's theatrical archives on CD-ROM. With a $50,000 grant, Seth created one of the first multimedia documentations of a performing artist's work, incorporating research photos, drawings, furniture design, rehearsal and performance video, and text for Wilson's "The Life and Times of Joseph Stalin."

In 1993, Seth brought his multimedia application to the Mediale Convention in Hamburg and the Frankfurt Book Fair, expanding his artistic technology work to Europe. His innovative approach caught the attention of William Forsythe of the Frankfurt Ballet, who invited Seth to create a similar multimedia presentation for his choreographic work. This collaboration resulted in "Improvisation Technologies," a groundbreaking digital documentation of Forsythe's dance methodology.

Simultaneously, Seth was invited by the Center for Art and Media Technology (ZKM) in Karlsruhe to become an Artist in Residence, helping develop their CD-ROM publishing lab. Working with Jeffrey Shaw at ZKM's Multimedia Lab further broadened Seth's exposure to digital art pioneers and strengthened his conviction that technology could transform artistic expression.`

    period: "1995-2000",
    title: "The Internet Pioneer",
    description: `When the World Wide Web emerged as a commercial medium in the mid-1990s, Seth recognized its transformative potential and returned to New York to engage with this new technology. He joined the World Wide Web Artists Consortium and produced websites for Agency.com, Michael Wolff's Your Personal Network, and Conde Nast's Epicurious.

"I had a couple of early Web gigs writing HTML code for Agency.com and Epicurious.com before starting my own Web advertising firm, SiteSpecific. We had a lot of fun creating new marketing campaigns (before it all became so toxic) and sold the firm to a larger agency a few years later."

In August 1995, at just 25 years old, Seth founded SiteSpecific, one of the first interactive marketing agencies. The company quickly evolved from Seth's apartment in New York City to a leading force in the nascent internet advertising industry. SiteSpecific created innovative campaigns for major brands like Duracell, Microsoft, and AT&T, pioneering many techniques that would become standard in digital marketing.

"It was really the glory years of the internet before it became overrun by MBAs and bankers and all sorts of mercenaries and opportunists. It was naïve and wonderful and it really felt like we were doing something original."

Within 18 months, SiteSpecific grew to over $3 million in annual revenue. The company became the subject of Harvard Business School's first case study on internet marketing, and Seth was recognized as one of Red Herring's Top 20 Entrepreneurs of the year. In 1997, SiteSpecific was acquired by CKS Group for approximately $12 million.

Following this success, Seth joined Flatiron Partners in 1999 as their first Entrepreneur-in-Residence and Investment Principal. Working alongside renowned VC Fred Wilson, Seth developed a $75 million portfolio focused on "pervasive computing" – technologies that would move the internet beyond desktop computers. His investments included wireless content provider Vindigo, Kozmo.com, and semiconductor company PortalPlayer, giving him front-row access to the dot-com boom's rapid evolution.

Seth organized the Flatiron Partners Pervasive Computing Portfolio conference in May 2000, bringing together management from over ten technology companies, investment professionals, industry analysts, and media representatives. The event facilitated cross-portfolio business development and established Flatiron's presence in the emerging wireless space. This initiative expanded when Esther Dyson invited Seth to organize a Pervasive Pavilion for her Spring PC Forum conference in Arizona.`

    period: "2002-2010",
    title: "Data and Research Innovation",
    description: `As the internet matured, Seth recognized the growing importance of data analytics. In 2002, he founded Majestic Research, a groundbreaking financial research firm that harnessed internet data to provide market insights. Years before "alternative data" became a Wall Street buzzword, Majestic Research analyzed web and commerce data to provide hedge funds with proprietary guidance.

"In 2009-2010 we were selling $200,000 worth of research to over 200 different hedge funds."

Serving as both CEO and later Chairman, Seth grew Majestic into a profitable enterprise that transformed how investment decisions were made. The company was acquired by Investment Technology Group (ITG) in 2010 for approximately $75 million, validating Seth's vision of data-driven financial services.

During this period, Seth's interest in consumer data rights emerged. In 2005, he co-founded Root Markets, an online mortgage exchange, and established the non-profit AttentionTrust.org in 2006. This organization advocated for personal information rights, distributing a free browser plugin that gave users more control over their data – a prescient concern that would become mainstream years later.`

    period: "2010-2016",
    title: "Social Media and Music Innovation",
    description: `As social networks gained popularity, Seth saw new opportunities at the intersection of technology and culture. In 2010, he co-founded Stickybits with Billy Chasen, envisioning an "augmented reality" platform that allowed users to attach digital content to real-world objects via barcodes. While ahead of its time for mainstream adoption, this venture demonstrated Seth's constant push toward emerging technological frontiers.

When Stickybits didn't gain the expected traction, Seth demonstrated his adaptability by pivoting the concept into Turntable.fm in 2011. This revolutionary social music platform allowed users to DJ and listen to music together in virtual rooms, creating an entirely new form of social interaction online. The site exploded to 600,000 users within four months.

"We didn't build up the hype but then we got accused of it dropping off. It's exactly the same in music when a new artist comes out. It's on us to keep evolving."

Turntable.fm secured $7 million in venture funding at a $37 million valuation, with Seth serving as Chairman. The platform became a cultural phenomenon, combining music, gaming, and social networking in a way that predated many later developments in virtual social spaces.

In 2012, Seth continued his exploration of digital music culture by founding DJZ, a content platform and mobile app catering to the booming electronic dance music (EDM) scene. DJZ combined news, videos, and interactive features for fans, and released the innovative iPhone app Crossfader that allowed anyone to remix music by tilting their phone.

In 2014, Seth co-authored "The Secret of Raising Money," a blueprint for entrepreneurs seeking funding. This book shared his accumulated wisdom on aligning with investors based on vision and values, not just valuation.

In 2016, Seth founded LiveAds, a creative agency and production studio focused on next-generation advertising content. This venture allowed him to apply his extensive experience in digital marketing and social media to help brands create engaging real-time content.`

    period: "2020-Present",
    title: "Web3 and Crypto Art Revolution",
    description: `The COVID-19 pandemic marked a pivotal moment in Seth's career, reconnecting his technological expertise with his artistic foundations. After moving to Venice Beach with his partner Kristi in 2020, he began experimenting with digital art, capturing photographs of Venice Beach sunsets and transforming them into AI-generated videos using GAN models.

"I woke up the next morning and realized that my NFT had been sold while I was asleep, and that there was ETH in my wallet. This was a breakthrough moment for me, as it dawned on me how significant this file format could be as a creative unlock. This moment reminded me of what I felt with the dawn of the Web in the summer of 1995."

In 2021, Seth founded Bright Moments, a crypto art gallery organized as a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). Beginning with a small gallery space beneath the Venice sign, Bright Moments pioneered the concept of "live minting" – creating immersive in-person experiences where artists and collectors could witness the generation of algorithmic art together in real time.

"What we stumbled onto is the special experience of a human being looking at a screen with other humans as a work of generative art is revealed for the first time. It's memorable because you're bringing something that is mathematically random into the real world."

Bright Moments quickly evolved from a local gallery to a global art movement. Seth established a systematic approach to building the DAO community through CryptoCitizens – unique, generative pixel-art NFTs that served as both art and membership tokens. Starting with 1,000 CryptoVenetians in Venice Beach, the project expanded to include unique collections for New York, Berlin, London, Mexico City, Tokyo, Buenos Aires, Paris, and Venice, Italy.

The Bright Moments journey concluded in April 2024 with "The Finale" at the Scuola Grande San Giovanni in Venice, Italy – bringing together almost every artist who participated in the DAO's previous projects.

"I know I'm not going to do something like this again in my lifetime. We accomplished something that goes beyond money or status—we said we were going to go to ten cities and we finished what we said we'd finish. I hope the art we supported will stand the test of time as a sort of canon, a time capsule of this chapter in the history of generative art."`
