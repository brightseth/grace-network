        The Council of Influences is not a governing body. It is a constellation of minds — both
        historical and living — whose ideas form the intellectual bedrock of our movement. These
        are the thinkers who saw the future clearly: who understood that powerful systems must be
        built with care, that justice must be designed in from the start, and that technology's
        highest purpose is universal human flourishing. We study them, cite them, and carry their
        work forward.
