# The Grace Network — Design System

## Aesthetic North Star

**Anthropic meets Shepard Fairey meets early positive Ethereum vibes.**

Think: The White Album. Andre 3000's *New Blue Sun*. A world computer as a network state.

## Principles

1. **Light, not dark** — Move away from heavy dark-mode crypto aesthetic. Lighter backgrounds, more breathing room. Positive, airy, confident.
2. **Minimal and simple** — Not ornamental. Every element earns its place. Clean typography, generous whitespace, clear hierarchy.
3. **Confident and neutral** — Not right-wing or left-wing. Centrist, rational, empathic. The design should feel post-partisan.
4. **Fun but serious** — Not sloppy, not stiff. The ease of someone who knows what they're doing. Approachable gravitas.
5. **Anti-slop** — No AI-generated aesthetic cliches. No gradient vomit, no unnecessary glow effects, no tech-bro energy. Intentional, human-feeling design.

## Reference Palette

| Reference | What to take from it |
|-----------|---------------------|
| **Anthropic** (anthropic.com) | Light backgrounds, clean sans-serif, generous spacing, quiet confidence, orange accent |
| **Shepard Fairey / OBEY** | Bold graphic language, political poster energy, iconic simplicity, high contrast when needed |
| **Early Ethereum** (2015-2017) | Optimism, world-building energy, "we're building the future" without arrogance, community-first |
| **The White Album** | Radical simplicity. White space as statement. Let the ideas breathe. |
| **Andre 3000 - New Blue Sun** | Unexpected, meditative, organic, unhurried. Not trying to impress. Just being. |

## Color Direction (evolving)

Current: Dark backgrounds with purple (#C8A2FF) and gold (#FFD700)
Target: Lighter, more Anthropic-like foundation with purposeful color moments

- **Primary background**: Warm white / off-white (not stark white)
- **Text**: Near-black, high readability
- **Accent**: Retain purple as the movement's signature, but softer — more lavender than neon
- **Gold**: Use sparingly for emphasis, warmth
- **Dark mode**: Available but not default

## Typography

- Clean, humanist sans-serif (not geometric/cold)
- Generous line height, comfortable reading
- Headlines: Confident weight but not shouty
- Body: Easy on the eyes, optimized for long-form reading

## Imagery

- Not AI slop. Curated, intentional.
- When generative: abstract, geometric, network-like — not photorealistic faces
- Political poster moments when appropriate (Fairey influence)
- Photography: real humans, real spaces, documentary feel

## What This Is NOT

- Crypto bro aesthetic (dark mode, neon, angular)
- Silicon Valley corporate (blue gradients, stock photos)
- Political party cliche (red/blue, flag motifs, eagles)
- Web3 slop (rainbow gradients, 3D renders, space themes)

## Figma Integration

Exploring Claude Code + Figma MCP for design-to-code workflow. Goal: maintain design fidelity from Figma components directly into the Astro codebase.
