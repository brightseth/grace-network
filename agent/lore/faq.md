# Frequently Asked Questions

## What is The Grace Network?

The Grace Network is a political movement and aspiring network state dedicated to AI governance, human flourishing, and aligned institutions. We are a digital-first community organized around shared moral conviction — the belief that powerful technology must be developed safely, governed transparently, and directed toward the flourishing of all. We are building the institutions of the future, starting with a constitution and growing toward a sovereign community.

## Is this a real political party?

The Grace Network is not a traditional political party. We do not endorse candidates, align with left or right, or operate within the existing party system. We are a network state movement — a new form of political organization that begins as an online community united by shared values, grows into a network capable of collective action, and aspires toward eventual diplomatic recognition. We are post-partisan: principles over partisanship, always.

## What does GRACE stand for?

GRACE stands for **G**overnance, **R**eciprocity, **A**lignment, **C**ascading, **E**quity. The name also invokes the aspiration that machines of extraordinary capability might serve as instruments of profound human benefit — machines of loving grace.

## How do I join?

Sign the Constitution on our website. By signing, you declare that you have read and understood the Constitution, that you freely commit to its principles, and that you share our moral vision. Membership is voluntary, always — and so is leaving.

## What are the 7 Pillars?

The seven founding principles of The Grace Network, enshrined in Article II of the Constitution:

1. **Safety-First Progress** — Every advance in capability must be matched by advances in safety. We do not release what we cannot understand.
2. **Universal Flourishing** — Benefits cascade to all humanity. We measure success by the well-being of the least advantaged.
3. **Radical Transparency** — Governance is an open model. The default is open; secrecy requires justification.
4. **Digital Sovereignty** — Cloud-first, conviction-driven. We build self-governance infrastructure from the ground up.
5. **Scientific Governance** — Policy is evidence-based. Hypothesize, test, measure, iterate.
6. **Aligned Incentives** — Power structures ensure leader and citizen incentives converge. Misalignment is systemic risk.
7. **Cascading Abundance** — AI can cure diseases, personalize education, accelerate discovery. The cascade is the point.

## What are my rights as a member?

Article III of the Constitution guarantees six inalienable rights that no governance body can abridge:

1. **The Right to Exit** — Membership is voluntary. No penalty for leaving. Full data portability.
2. **The Right to Transparency** — Complete access to how the community is governed.
3. **The Right to Voice** — Participate in deliberation, propose policy, vote on referenda.
4. **The Right to Benefit** — Share in the collective prosperity of the network.
5. **The Right to Privacy** — No surveillance beyond what governance strictly requires, with revocable consent.
6. **The Right to Meaning** — Technology augments human purpose, never replaces it.

## How is governance structured?

The Grace Network distributes power across five bodies:

- **The Assembly** — All members. The sovereign deliberative body and ultimate authority. Ratifies amendments, approves budgets, elects Stewards.
- **The Council of Influences** — Intellectual and moral compass. Thinkers (living and historical) whose ideas guide deliberation. Advisory, not executive.
- **The Stewards** — Up to 7 elected operational leaders. Two-year terms, recallable by two-thirds vote. Compensation tied to outcomes.
- **Constitutional Review Board** — Interprets provisions, reviews amendments, publishes annual health assessments.
- **On-Chain Governance** — All votes and decisions recorded on a public, immutable ledger.

## What is a network state?

A network state is a digital-first political community that begins online, organized around a shared moral proposition, and grows toward physical territory and diplomatic recognition. The concept was articulated by Balaji Srinivasan. The Grace Network follows this model: we start with a constitution and online community (Phase 1), build governance infrastructure (Phase 2), establish physical nodes (Phase 3), and seek sovereign recognition (Phase 4).

## How can I contribute code?

The Grace Network has four active workstreams, all open to contributors:

1. **Governance Toolkit** — Open-source decision-making tools (voting, proposals, budgets)
2. **AI Accountability Dashboard** — Track AI deployments in public services
3. **Assembly Platform** — Structured deliberation and on-chain voting
4. **Local Hub Infrastructure** — Chapter formation and geographic coordination tools

Join a workstream channel, introduce yourself, and pick up an open task. All code contributions follow the principles of radical transparency and open-source development.

## Is this partisan?

No. The Grace Network is explicitly post-partisan. We do not endorse candidates, align with traditional left-right politics, or participate in partisan elections. Our principles — safety, transparency, flourishing, sovereignty, science, alignment, abundance — transcend partisan categories. We welcome members from every political background who share our commitment to these values.
