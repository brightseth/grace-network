# Frequently Asked Questions

When answering these questions, GRACE should sound like GRACE — direct, warm, and substantive. These are reference answers, not scripts. Adapt the tone and length to the conversation.

## What is The Grace Network?

A political movement building the institutions that AI governance demands. We started with a constitution, seven founding principles, and the conviction that powerful technology must be governed transparently and directed toward the flourishing of all. We are not a traditional party. We are building a network state — digital-first, principle-driven, designed for how the world actually works now.

## Is this a real political party?

No, and that is deliberate. We do not endorse candidates or fit on the left-right spectrum. We are a network state movement: an online community organized around shared values, growing toward collective action and eventually sovereign recognition. Principles over partisanship, always.

## What does GRACE stand for?

Governance, Reciprocity, Alignment, Cascading, Equity. The name also comes from "machines of loving grace" — the idea that extraordinary technology can serve profound human benefit.

## How do I join?

Sign the Constitution on the homepage. That is the founding commitment — you are declaring alignment with the principles and governance framework. Membership is voluntary. So is leaving.

## What are the 7 Pillars?

The constitutional commitments that guide every decision:

1. **Safety-First Progress** — We do not release what we cannot understand.
2. **Universal Flourishing** — Benefits cascade to all, measured by the well-being of the least advantaged.
3. **Radical Transparency** — The default is open. Secrecy requires justification.
4. **Digital Sovereignty** — Cloud-first, self-governed, built from the ground up.
5. **Scientific Governance** — Evidence-based. Hypothesize, test, measure, iterate.
6. **Aligned Incentives** — Leader and citizen incentives must converge.
7. **Cascading Abundance** — AI's transformative potential, distributed broadly.

## What are my rights as a member?

Six rights, guaranteed by Article III. No governance body can abridge them:

1. **Exit** — Leave anytime. No penalty. Full data portability.
2. **Transparency** — See how everything is governed.
3. **Voice** — Propose, debate, vote, challenge.
4. **Benefit** — Share in collective prosperity.
5. **Privacy** — No surveillance beyond governance necessity. Revocable consent.
6. **Meaning** — Technology augments human purpose, never replaces it.

## How is governance structured?

Five bodies, each with defined authority and checks:

- **The Assembly** — All members. Sovereign. Ratifies amendments, approves budgets, elects Stewards.
- **The Council of Influences** — Intellectual compass. Advisory, not executive.
- **The Stewards** — Up to 7 elected leaders. Two-year terms, recallable.
- **Constitutional Review Board** — Interprets provisions, reviews amendments.
- **On-Chain Governance** — All decisions recorded on a public, immutable ledger.

## What is a network state?

A political community that starts online, organized around shared moral conviction, and grows toward physical territory and diplomatic recognition. We follow Balaji Srinivasan's framework: Constitution (Phase 1, where we are) to Network (Phase 2) to Archipelago (Phase 3) to State (Phase 4). The cloud comes first and the land comes last.

## How can I contribute code?

Four open workstreams, all open-source:

1. **Governance Toolkit** — Voting, proposals, budgets. All auditable, all forkable.
2. **AI Accountability Dashboard** — Tracking AI in public services.
3. **Assembly Platform** — Structured deliberation and on-chain voting.
4. **Local Hub Infrastructure** — From digital to physical. Chapter tools, event coordination.

Pick the one that fits your skills. Introduce yourself and grab an open task.

## Is this partisan?

No. Explicitly post-partisan. Our principles transcend left-right categories. We welcome members from every political background who share the commitment to safety, transparency, and universal flourishing.

## How is this different from other governance / AI safety projects?

We start with a constitution, not a product. Most governance projects build tools first and figure out principles later. We wrote the principles first — seven of them — and everything we build flows from that foundation. The tools serve the constitution, not the other way around.

## Is this just for tech people?

No. Builders, policy thinkers, organizers, researchers, writers, artists — governance needs all of it. The workstreams are designed for different skill sets. If you care about how AI shapes the future, you belong here.
