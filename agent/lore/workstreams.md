# Active Workstreams

The Grace Network organizes its building efforts into four workstreams. Each is a focused area of collective action, open to all members, and governed by the principles of radical transparency and scientific governance.

## 1. Governance Toolkit

**Status**: Planning

### Description
An open-source suite of transparent decision-making tools designed for digital-first communities. The Governance Toolkit will provide the infrastructure for The Assembly to deliberate, vote, and govern — with every decision auditable and every rationale legible.

### Goals
- Build ranked-choice and quadratic voting modules
- Create proposal drafting and comment-period workflows
- Implement transparent budget allocation dashboards
- Develop quorum tracking and participation analytics
- Ensure all tools are open-source and forkable by other communities

### Tech Stack
TBD — evaluating frameworks for on-chain voting, decentralized identity integration, and real-time deliberation. Likely to include smart contract platforms (Ethereum/L2), web-based frontends, and cryptographic identity verification.

### How to Contribute
- **Developers**: Smart contract development, frontend engineering, UX design for governance interfaces
- **Policy thinkers**: Voting system design, quorum mechanics, deliberation process architecture
- **Researchers**: Comparative analysis of existing digital governance tools (Snapshot, Tally, Colony, Aragon)

## 2. AI Accountability Dashboard

**Status**: Planning

### Description
A public-facing dashboard that tracks AI deployments in public services — making visible which systems are being used, by whom, for what purpose, and with what safeguards. Radical transparency applied to the AI systems that affect citizens' lives.

### Goals
- Catalog AI systems deployed in government and public services
- Track safety certifications, audit results, and incident reports
- Provide risk assessments and interpretability scores
- Create public notification mechanisms for new deployments
- Enable community review and comment on deployed systems

### Tech Stack
TBD — likely a web application with data collection pipelines, public API, and visualization layer. Will integrate with existing AI audit frameworks and government transparency databases where available.

### How to Contribute
- **Developers**: Data pipelines, API design, frontend visualization
- **Researchers**: AI audit methodologies, risk assessment frameworks, policy analysis
- **Journalists and investigators**: FOIA requests, procurement tracking, case studies
- **Designers**: Information design for complex accountability data

## 3. Assembly Platform

**Status**: Planning

### Description
The digital home of The Assembly — where members propose, debate, and ratify governance changes. Not just a forum but a structured deliberation environment designed for reasoned, transparent, and inclusive decision-making at scale.

### Goals
- Build structured proposal submission and review workflows
- Implement deliberation tools (threaded debate, synthesis summaries, argument mapping)
- Create on-chain voting with privacy-preserving ballot integrity
- Enable asynchronous and synchronous deliberation modes
- Integrate with the Governance Toolkit for seamless governance operations

### Tech Stack
TBD — evaluating deliberation platforms (Polis-inspired), real-time communication layers, and on-chain voting contracts. Must support both desktop and mobile participation.

### How to Contribute
- **Developers**: Full-stack development, real-time systems, smart contracts
- **UX designers**: Deliberation flow design, accessibility, mobile-first interfaces
- **Political scientists**: Deliberative democracy process design, moderation frameworks
- **Community managers**: Testing, feedback collection, pilot facilitation

## 4. Local Hub Infrastructure

**Status**: Planning

### Description
Tools and frameworks for forming physical nodes of The Grace Network — local chapters, coworking spaces, meetup infrastructure, and eventually residential enclaves. The bridge from Phase 1 (Constitution) toward Phase 3 (Archipelago).

### Goals
- Create chapter formation guides and legal templates
- Build member-finder tools for geographic clustering
- Develop event coordination and space-sharing platforms
- Establish inter-hub communication and governance coordination
- Provide resources for crowdfunding shared physical spaces

### Tech Stack
TBD — likely web-based tools for geographic member discovery, event management, and inter-hub coordination. Integration with the Assembly Platform for local governance decisions.

### How to Contribute
- **Organizers**: Local event planning, community building, chapter formation
- **Developers**: Geographic tools, event platforms, member discovery
- **Legal**: Nonprofit formation, property acquisition frameworks, international jurisdictional guidance
- **Designers**: Brand templates, local signage, physical space design guidelines

## Getting Involved

Every workstream is open to all members. To contribute:

1. Read the Constitution to understand our principles and governance structure
2. Identify the workstream that matches your skills and interests
3. Join the workstream channel and introduce yourself
4. Pick up an open task or propose a new initiative

All workstream progress is tracked transparently and reported to The Assembly.
